Using RLE compression and decompression the program takes a string and either compresses or decompresses it. The programs knows which one to do based on if the string has .rle or not. If it has .rle it will compress the string and if it doesn't it will decompress the string.

The program uses argv so to use it you need to include the string after you the call the program. An example would be python3 rle.py string.rle. That is what you would enter if using the program in linux.
